# Jump Research
In this project, I'm looking for the variables that affect a jump in a 2D game

> **Note:** Changing the next values will affect the feedback of the jump. The purpose here is to test different configurations.

## maxSpeed
The maximum velocity the player can reach (in pixel per tick)
## inertia
The acceleration the player get until he reaches the maxSpeed (in pixel per tick per tick)
## floorAdhesion
The deceleration the player get until he reaches 0 while touching the floor (in pixel per tick per tick)
## jumpForce
The initial vertical speed when starting a jump
## gravity
The deceleration the player get vertically while jumping
## airResistance
The deceleration the player get until he reaches 0 while jumping (in pixel per tick per tick)
## airControl
The modifier of inertia while jumping
